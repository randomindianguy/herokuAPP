# herokuAPP
This dynamic webpage allows users to sign up to my (fake) newsletter. 

Oh my, was this a tough one to get through!

Pain Points: 
- not knowing what API calls to add. It was a bunch of trial and error, reading documentation to figure out what was needed for the API calls.
- including local CSS files to get applied to my webpage was a rather annoying part to figure out. It took me a couple of tries to figure this one out.
- Deploying heroku CLI to my system. It did not work with my terminal initially.
